# 🏦 Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

This project demonstrates how data analytics can be applied in the **banking and financial services** sector to gain insights into customer behavior and minimize risks, especially in **loan lending**. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL integration, and Power BI, this project builds a fully interactive **banking risk analytics dashboard**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

> **Objective**: Develop a basic understanding of **risk analytics** in banking and understand how data is used to **minimize the risk of losing money** while lending to customers.

Financial institutions face significant risk when issuing loans to customers. This project uses customer-level banking data to analyze trends, detect patterns, and identify insights that can inform safer, smarter lending decisions.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** – For performing EDA using Python
- **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib** – For statistical analysis and data visualization
- **MySQL** – For storing and querying structured banking data
- **Power BI** – For building an interactive dashboard with business insights
- **CSV Files** – As the primary data source

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA was performed in **Jupyter Notebook** and included:

- 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- 🔹 Numerical Analysis
- 🔹 Bivariate Analysis
- 🔹 Heatmap Correlation Matrix
- 🔹 Data Visualizations

### 🔍 Key Insight:

> The strongest **positive correlation** was found between:
>
> - **Bank Deposits** and **Checking Accounts**
> - **Bank Deposits** and **Foreign Currency Accounts**
>
> This indicates that customers who maintain high balances in one account type are likely to hold **substantial funds across multiple account types** — suggesting greater financial stability and potentially **lower lending risk**.

## 🗄️ Data Handling

- CSV files were loaded into **Jupyter Notebook** for EDA.
- Data was cleaned and transformed.
- The processed data was imported into a **MySQL** database.
- Power BI was then connected directly to the MySQL database for real-time data visualization.
